// OOP = OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is an approach in programming in which data is encapsulated within objects and the object itself is operated on, rather than its component parts.
// JavaScript is heavily object-oriented. It follows a prototype-based model (as opposed to class-based).

// Objects - Object, property, and method

// Object Literal

let name = { username: 'VedaGna' };

console.log(name); //{ username: 'VedaGna' }
console.log(typeof name); // object
