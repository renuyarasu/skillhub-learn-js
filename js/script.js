// Summary

1. Objects means simply real world entities such as mobile, laptop, bike, car, cat etc., 
2. Class is a blueprint for creating objects. We can create objects in different ways in JavaScript by using functions, object literals etc., 
3. Encapsulation is a method to hide the data in a single entity or unit along with a method to protect information from outside. 
4. Abstraction is the method that "shows" only essential attributes and "hides" unnecessary information. 
5. Inheritance is a mechanism where you can derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods. 
6. Polymorphism means having many forms. 
7. JavaScript supports only overriding functionality because there is no type checking functionality.
